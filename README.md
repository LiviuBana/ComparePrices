## Application design

The ASP.NET[14] Web API app serves to retrieve the data stored in the MySQL database,to manipulate and to manage these data .
I used it to create backend services that allow my Angular application to communicate with them through HTTP requests.

Some key features of Entity Framework that I used in my  ASP.NET Web API app :
-	Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Entity Framework maps database tables to .NET classes and database columns to class properties. This enables developers to work with database records using familiar object-oriented concepts.
-	LINQ Integration: Entity Framework integrates with Language Integrated Query (LINQ), allowing you to write expressive queries using C# or VB.NET syntax. These queries are then translated into SQL by Entity Framework.
-	Database Providers: Entity Framework supports various database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more, allowing you to work with different types of databases using a consistent API.

Entity Framework aims to increase developer productivity by reducing the need to write repetitive data access code and manual SQL queries.
It abstracts many complexities of working with databases, making it a popular choice for developers building .NET applications that interact with relational databases.
